I started making jastl just for convenience and experience. It compiles into a library file you will find in the `build/` folder, and an executable for unit testing, also present in that same folder.

Using it in a project should hopefully be as simple as adding the `.a` to wherever you wanna link it from, and then also having a folder with all the headers in it.

Another goal is that it should have clear and helpful documentation for all its components.

The name means "**jas**(thats me) **t**emplate **l**ibrary"! =]
